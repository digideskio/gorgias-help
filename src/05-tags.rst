========

Tags help with filtering and categorization of quicktexts. You can add a tag to a quicktext by updating the 'Tags' field.

Once that's done you can start filtering the quicktexts by clicking (thus enabling and disabling) the tags you want to filter by under the search menu.

You can find out more about search in the 'Search' section.
