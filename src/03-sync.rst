Synchronization
===========================

If you have Google Chrome installed on multiple devices you can synchronize QG quicktexts between machines. Here's you do it:

Please make sure that you have the QG extension installed on you Google Chrome before following the steps bellow.

 1. Using the same Google Chrome session Login or Register on the https://gmail-quicktext.com/
 2. Open the Options QG extension options.
 3. Click on `Sync Now` button.

Now all you quicktexts in the browser should be synchronized with the gmail-quicktext.com website.

Now in order to get your quicktexts syncronized with other machines repeat the steps above (but this time just login to your gmail-quicktext.com account).

How does synchronization work?
---------------------------------

Every time you hit the `Sync Now` button all your quicktexts are uploaded and stored to the gmail-quicktext via a secure SSL connection. All you quicktexts can now be shared between computers or with other members of your team.

Syncing not only uploads all your quicktexts it also updates the quicktexts that have been modified on other computers or downloads the quicktexts shared by your team.
