Synchronization
===============

If you have Google Chrome installed on multiple devices you can synchronize
your templates between machines. Here's how you do it:

Please make sure that you have the `Gorgias` extension installed_ on you
Google Chrome before following the steps bellow.

 1. Open the 'Options' for `Gorgias` from Extensions menu in Google Chrome.
 2. `Login` or `Register` if your not yet registered on the https://gorgias.io/ website.
 3. Click on `Sync Now` button (it takes a second or 2).
 4. Optionally refresh the page if you don't see them right away.

Now all your quicktexts should be synchronized with the Synchronization server.

In order to get your templates synchronized with other machines repeat
the steps above (but this time just Login).

How does synchronization work?
------------------------------

Every time the synchronization process starts all your templates are uploaded
and stored to the https://gorgias.io/ via a secure HTTPS connection.

The uploaded templates can now be shared between computers or with other members of your team using the https://gorgias.io
interface.

Syncing not only uploads all your templates it also updates the templates
that have been modified on other computers or downloads the new templates shared
by your team.

.. note:: No templates are ever deleted! Unless you specifically demand it.
          In order to completely delete your data please send an e-mail to support@gorgias.io
