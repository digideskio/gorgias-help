Automatic Suggestions
======================

Automatic suggestions helps finding the correct quicktext as you type. Imagine that you have a quicktext that explains to your users that they have to check their spam inbox::

    Quicktext Title: Remind the user that they can check the spam box
    Quicktext Body: Note: If you can't find the e-mail, please check your spam box in order to find... 

Now when you type spam in the body of your e-mail a small popup will appear where you can choose the correct quicktext.


When the automatic suggestions are triggered?
------------------------------------------------

Automatic suggestions are triggered when you type a word that is found inthis order:

 - The title of the quicktext contains the word.
 - Is one of the tags of the quicktext
 - The body of the quicktext
