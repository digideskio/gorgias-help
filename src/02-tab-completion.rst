Disabling Tab completion
---------------------------------

Tab completion is cool, but if you want to disable it for some reason you can do so by going to:

 1. Google Chrome
 2. Customize and Control Google Chrome
 3. Tools
 4. Extensions
 5. Gorgias for Gmail
 6. Options
 7. Uncheck `Tab Completion` option.

You can also get to the Options faster by right-clicking the Gorgias extension
icon in the top right corner and selecting Options.

.. note:: The `Gorgias` icon only appears when using Gmail.
