Tags help with filtering and categorization of templates. You can add a tag to
a template by updating the 'Tags' field.

Once that's done you can start filtering your templates by clicking the tags you want to filter by.

.. note:: You can filter other templates with the same tag by clicking on the tag labels.

You can you can also use :ref:`search` if you want a more advanced filter.
